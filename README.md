# Coding-Challenge-5
This is a repository for Coding-Challenge- for the ISM3232 Class where we will create a Customer Order Management System.
In this challenge, we will create a system to manage orders so that it can take orders, calculate order totals, manage its inventory, while ensuring inventory stock is sufficient to complete an order. It will also be able to track the status of orders.
 We will use a variety to JavaScript concepts, including functions, objects and arrays to accomplish this task.
